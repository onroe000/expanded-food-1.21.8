**This is my first Minecraft mod made with Fabric.** Adds some variety to the food in the vanilla game. Some recipes alleviate the need for food early stage, some help to put "useless" food to good use.

This is a test version. It should work as intended. Textures was made using vanilla Minecraft textures and open source images. I plan updates and improvements.
